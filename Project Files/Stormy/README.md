In this project, we're going to build a weather app together and broaden our understanding of Swift and Cocoa Touch frameworks. We will also learn foundational concepts like concurrency and networking while building on our existing knowledge of data modeling, Auto Layout and more. By the end of this project you will have built your second iOS app and be well on your way to becoming an iOS developer.
