# YAWA
Yet-Another-Weather-App (YAWA) is my attempt at picking up Swift

I followed a course on TeamTreehouse, an introduction to Swift on my part, and instead of writing the same old Hello World apps I decided to write a fully functional app

I spent the weekend watching the entire TeamTreehouse course (on 2x ofcourse) and wrote the entire code while standing in my kitchen, basically what am trying to say is the code quality is somewhat lacking.

##TODO
- Settings screen?
- Allow user to Add/Edit cusom locations
- Add paging to support above feature
- Write tests (Should have started)
- Publish to the app store
- ~~Weekly forcast (Model already in place)~~
- ~~Animation, its a one screen app after all~~
- ~~Retrieve Current Location~~
- ~~Improve UI~~
